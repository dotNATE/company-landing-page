# Company Landing Page - Practice Project

## Intro

A small landing page for a fictional business. This is to practice building and styling a webpage using HTML and CSS.

This project is part of the Full Stack Engineer Career Path on Code Academy (www.codecademy.com). Instead of a step-by-step tutorial, this project contains a series of open-ended requirements which describe the project.

The tasks given to me focus on three main areas: content, flexbox styling, and creating custom CSS styles.

### Content

1. A title and logo or splash image.
2. A mission statement or brief description of the company.
3. A list or set of images and titles representing the product or products of the company.
4. A section describing some of the companyâ€™s employees or teammates.

### Flexbox Styling

1. Create a centered navbar at the top of the page.
2. Create a flexible display of company products that changes from a more grid-like list to a column list as the page shrinks.
3. Create a flexible display of company employees.

### Custom CSS

1. A simple color scheme using CSS named colors, but yours can be more elaborate with hexadecimal, RGB, or HSL colors.
2. Fonts from the Google Fonts API.
3. Custom images.

## Technologies

HTML5, CSS3
